# How to Run Project

Follow these steps to run your Node.js project:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Change the current working directory to your project's server directory. Use the command:
    ```
    cd /server
    ```

3. Install the project dependencies. Use the command:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the project in development mode. Use the command:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

5. Open a new terminal instance for running the client side of the project. You need to navigate to the client directory and run the http-server. Use the following commands:

    ```bash
    cd /client
    npx http-server
    ```

After following these steps, both the server and client of your Node.js project should be running.
